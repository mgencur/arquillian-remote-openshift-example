In order to run the functional test suite against a remote OpenShift instance, follow these steps:

1. Login to the remote instance from command line using `oc`

   oc login <openshift address> --token=<token>

2. Set the environment variable with the adddress of the remote OpenShift docker registry

   export OPENSHIFT_ONLINE_REGISTRY=<registry address>

3. Invoke `make test-remote`.
This procedure will create a new project in the remote OpenShift, build the image, push the image to the OpenShift internal registry, install the templates in the project and invoke functional tests.
